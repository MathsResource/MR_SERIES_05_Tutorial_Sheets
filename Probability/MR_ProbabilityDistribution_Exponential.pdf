\item Each 500-ft roll of sheet steel includes two flaws on average. What is the probability that as the sheet 
steel is unrolled the first flaw occurs within the first 50-ft segment?

% \begin{itemize}
%
%	\item Average per 500-ft roll = 2.0
%
%	\item average per 50-ft segment = 2.0/10 = 0.20
%
%	\item $P(X \leq 50)$
%
%	\[ = 1 - e^{-\lambda} = 1 - e^{-0.20}\] = 1-0.81873 = 0.18127

\item 
The recovery time for a fracture of the lower leg for adults 
is approximated by the exponential distribution, with a mean recovery (or healing) time of 80 days.
Calculate the probabilities of the following recovery times.
\begin{itemize}
\item [(a)] A fracture is healed within 60 days.
\item [(b)] A fracture takes at least 80 days to heal properly.
\item [(c)] A fracture will heal within 75 days and 120 days.
\end{itemize}

\item 
A machine is said to have a mean failure free lifetime of 2000 hours. What is the probability that the machine will last:

\begin{itemize}

	\item[(a)]	at least 1000 hours

	\item[(b)]	at least 1500 hours

	\item[(c)]	less than 800 hours

	\item[(d)]	less than 1800 hours

\end{itemize}

\item 
The average lifespan of a laptop is 5 year. You may assume that the lifespan of laptop computers follows an exponential distribution.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

	\item What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will be at least 6 years.

	\item What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will not exceed 4 years.

	\item What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will be between 5 years and 6 years.

\end{enumerate}

\item 


An average of five calls per hour are received by a machine repair department. 

Beginning the observation at any point in time, compute the following probabilites



\begin{itemize} 

	\item[(a)] that the first call for service will arrive within ten minutes.

	\item[(b)] that the first call for service will not arrive for 30 minutes.

\end{itemize}
%======================================================================================%


% \begin{itemize}
%
%	\item $\mu$ = Average per hour = 5.0
%
%	\item $\lambda= \mu$ = Average per half hour = 2.5
%
%	\item $P(X \leq 2.5) $
%
%	\[P(X \leq 2.5) = 1 - e^{-2.5} = 1 - 0.08208 = 0.91792\]

\item Faults occur in a fibre optic cable at the rate of 0.5 per 10KM of cable.  Calculate the probability that:



\begin{itemize}

	\item[(a)] Exactly 2 flaws will occur in a given 10KM section

	\item[(b)] 4 or more flaws will occur in a given 10KM section

	\item[(c)] Eircom are providing 100KM fibre optic connection between Limerick and Cork.  
	What is the probability of 7 or more flaws in the 100KM section?
