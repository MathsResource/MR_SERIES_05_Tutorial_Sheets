	\item  Find the area enclosed by the curves $y=x^2-6x+5$ and $y=x-5$.
%\item Find the area enclosed by the curve $y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$ and the x axis.
\item  Find the area enclosed by the curves $y=x^2-7x+12$ and $y=x-7$.
	\item  Find the area enclosed by the curve $y = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$ and the x axis.
		\item Find the area enclosed by the curve $y=1+2x-x^2$ and the line $y=x-1$.
	Clearly state the points of intersection in your answer.
	\item  A current $i(t) = 4 + 5\cos(3t)$ passes through a capacitor at time $t$.
