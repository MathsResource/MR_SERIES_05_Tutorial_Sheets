\item 
The strength of dosage of a plant growth enhancement chemical is often measured by the proportion of plants that grow faster. A particular dosage of the chemical is fed to 115 plants of these plants, 94 actually show faster growth.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Calculate a point estimate $\hat{p}$ for the proportion of plants, $\pi$, that grow faster due to the dosage. 									 
\item  What is the standard error of the estimate? 			
\item  Find a 95\% confidence interval for $\pi$. 				
% \item What size sample is required to give the estimate in (c) to within $\pm1\%$. 	
%\item Carry out a testing procedure to investigate the claim that the chemical is 90\% effective. 	
\end{enumerate}

 \item An environmental group states that ``\textit{fewer than 60\% of industrial plants comply with air pollution standards}``. An independent researcher takes a sample of 120 plants and finds that 78 are complying with air pollution standards. 


 \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 \item  Carry out a hypothesis test to investigate the claim made by the environmental group. Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses and your conclusion.
